After creating the JAR files, I've imported the JAR files into Eclipse again AND IMPORTED THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES. I've checked that there's no compilation error.
I will lose 50% if that's not the case.

Instructions:
Get Map -> Gets the map, no auto focus for arrow keys.
Exit -> Closes program.
Sliders -> Does stuff to map, auto focuses on map, allowing arrow keys.
Size -> Changes the display size, does not auto focus for arrow keys.
Click on map -> Focuses on map to allow arrow keys to work
Drop down list -> Has pre-made locations for the map
Add location button -> Adds the current location to the drop down list for later use
Save location button -> Saves an image of the current map to your local file system

Known "visual" issues: sliders do not automatically update with arrow keys

When you are trying to compile the file: PLEASE MANUALLY INCLUDE ALL LIBRARIES FROM:
